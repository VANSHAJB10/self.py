# Lists and dictionary

Similar to Lists there are multiple ways of deleting elements from a dictionary.

The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:
The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name and can also delete the whole dictionary
The clear() method empties the dictionary:

With the "for" loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, string etc.
EXAMPLE-- 
color = ["Red","Blue","Green","Black"]
for x in color:
  print(x)
